## [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification)
* Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor in the brain which is the most common form of brain cancer in adults and with the worst prognosis.
* A specific genetic sequence in the tumor known as MGMT promoter methylation is a favorable prognostic factor.
* The current competition requires to predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI scans to train and test model to detect the presence of MGMT.
